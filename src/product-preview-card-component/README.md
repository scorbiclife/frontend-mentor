## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Responsive images (`image` tag `srcset` property)
- I did know about the emphasis tag (`em`) and the strikethrough tag (`s`)
  but did not realize I could use it here. Updated.
- I designed the mobile page and the desktop page separately,
  and then updated the text.
